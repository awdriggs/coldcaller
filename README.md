# MS839 Name Randomizer

## Equity Practice
I started using a random name caller to increase the equity of voices heard in class. To support students I taught into using discussion prompts so everyone could feel like they could contribute valuably.

## Process
I chose to implement this practice to increase equity of voice in the classroom. I was noticing that a lot of the same students were always the ones to ask and answer questions. Also students were sharing in order to seem "smart" and get individual accolades.

I was trying to dismantle the characteristic of individualism.
 
## Evidence
### Hopes and Aspirations
- Increase equity of voice in the classroom
- Increase collective knowledge over individual sharing.
- Increase student ownership of class discussions.

### Impacts
- Using "Turn and Talks" to prime students for responding. 
- Giving prompts and asking for "saybacks" for low stakes share out.  
 - “I think…”
 - “I heard _____ say ____.”
 - “I agree/disagree with ____ because ____”
 - “Could ____ explain their thinking again?”

### What Students Say...
> Keeps us on topic because we know we might be called
> Try to think of an answer for each question.
> Think faster

## Key Learnings
- Overall there was much more equity of student voice and more on focused discussions.
- At times the use of the name caller can make the discussion feel inauthentic.
- Even low stakes sharing is a huge challenge for some students.

## Areas of Growth
- Begin using the name randomizer at the beginning of the year.
- Use the name caller for most share outs after turn and talks and 'low stakes' share outs.
- Mix in with other EL discussion protocols.
